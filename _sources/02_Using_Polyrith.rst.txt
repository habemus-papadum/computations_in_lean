Using polyrith
==============

This section and :ref:`the next<projective_curves>` can be read independently. They present a
series of extended examples, showing how to transform problems into nails which the ``polyrith``
hammer can hit.

The focus in this section is on making sure that ``polyrith`` has all the hypotheses it needs to
solve a problem.
