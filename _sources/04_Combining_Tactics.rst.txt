Combining tactics
=================

In this last section we cover examples where several tactics need to be combined to complete a
computation.

We will start with a discussion of the tactic ``field_simp``, which is used in working with
fractions; it clears denominators so that ``ring`` or ``polyrith`` can be applied.

Later we will give two extended examples in which ``polyrith`` and ``field_simp`` are combined as
needed with ``norm_cast`` (and variants), to deal with casts among different number systems
(:math:`\mathbb{N}`, :math:`\mathbb{Z}`, :math:`\mathbb{Q}`, :math:`\mathbb{R}`,
:math:`\mathbb{C}`) and with ``(n)linarith`` (to prove inequalities).  But we will not give a
detailed description of these other tactics.
